# Developer docs

Welcome to the ethrex developer docs!

This section contains documentation on the internals of the project.

To get started first, read the developer [installation guide](./installing.md) to learn about ethrex and its features. Then you can look into the [L1 developer docs](../developers/l1/introduction.md) or the [L2 developer docs](../developers/l2/introduction.md)

If you work from a fork (`theo-learner/ethrex`) while syncing from upstream (`lambdaclass/ethrex`), see the [fork workflow guide](./fork-workflow.md).

For an idea-based product strategy assessment of Ethrex (RaaS, Native L2 integration, latency routing), see the [project analysis](./project-analysis.md).

For autonomous operations planning, see [Ops Agent 구현 계획](../ops-agent/implementation-plan.md), [Ops Agent 모니터링 통합 전략](../ops-agent/monitoring-integration.md), and [Ops Agent 6개월 구현 로드맵](../ops-agent/roadmap-6months.md).
